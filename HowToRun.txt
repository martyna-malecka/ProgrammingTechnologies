In order to have the program work correctly, a database which corresponds 
to DB.png image needs to be created with all columns having NOT NULL constraint. 

The database should be then connected to the VideoRentalData project either by changing
the value of 'Name' variable in DataClasses.designer.cs file or a whole new DataClasses.dbml LINQ to SQL class
should be created inside the VideoRentalData project and the database tables should then be dragged and dropped
into the layout (the second approach is recommended).

All tables must contain at least one entry for the program to work correctly.
